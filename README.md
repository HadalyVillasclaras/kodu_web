### Description & goals

In this project, my focus has been on implementing  a **Design System** I initially conceptualized on Figma. The main goal was to be able to traslate this visual system into code, ensuring consistent theming, **component modularity** for ensuring **UI re-usability**, and scalability. 

The styles were crafted with SCSS using a mixture of methodologies and architectures such as **BEM**, **Atomic Design** or **ITCSS**. I've not wanted to be strictly bound to them, but to use them to my own advantage and according to the needs of my system.

Throughout the project, I've aimed to retain the integrity of the original design, optimizing for **performance**, **responsiveness**, and **user experience**.
